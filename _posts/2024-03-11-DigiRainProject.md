## Introduction
So lets define what Digital Rain actually is: _Matrix digital rain, or Matrix code, is the computer code featured in the Matrix series._[1] So it was first referenced in the movie, The Matrix; orginally created by Simon Whiteley and his Wife, the iconic digital rain sequence has featured in many video games and movies alike since its debut. The breakdown of what Digital Rain actullay is can be summed up to lines of random numbers/letter that are printed ina  single/multiple lines to create a raindrop effect.
